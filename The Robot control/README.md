# The Robot Control Assignment


Part of my uni project for the Programming course. In this assignment I will be required to control the movement of a robot arm which moves blocks from a “source” pile to a “target” pile. 

Written in Java and run with Eclipse

## How to run

After compiling the script, to run in the command prompt, type the following, and the it will display in the sample screenshot below

`java Robot 435214 12311`

Where `435214` is the bar heights and `12311` is the block heights from the source.

To run in Eclipse, select run --> Run configurations, give it a name "Robot" then click arguments to specify the bar and block heights when running the program
