# First Person Shooter (FPS) in Unity

The main goal is to create a virtual reality immersive user interface for my apartment 3D model in a first person view. 

Built in Unity 3D, the scripts contain snippets of players to pick up objects, drop objects, look and move around.

The scripts were never implemented into the VR game build.
